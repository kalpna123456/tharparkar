        <h2>Gori Temple</h2>
        <p>Gori Temple, also known as Gori Mandir or Gori jo Mandar, is an ancient Jain temple located in the Tharparkar district of Sindh, Pakistan. It was built around the 14th century, approximately in 1375 AD, and is dedicated to Lord Parshvanath, the 23rd Tirthankara of Jainism. Gori Temple is considered one of the oldest and most beautiful Jain temples in Sindh.</p>
         <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>The architecture of Gori Temple is remarkable and artistically rich. The temple is made of white marble, which gives it a bright and elegant appearance — hence it is often called the “Gori Temple of White Marble.” It consists of 52 small shrines built around a large central hall. The walls and pillars are decorated with delicate carvings and patterns that reflect the artistic brilliance of ancient Jain craftsmanship.</p>
         <h2>Religious Importance</h2>
         <p>Gori Temple holds deep religious significance for the Jain community. It was once an active place of worship where devotees came for prayer and meditation. The temple enshrined the idol of Lord Parshvanath, who is highly revered in Jainism. Even though worship no longer takes place here, it remains an important spiritual and historical site for followers of the Jain faith.</p>

Impressed by her honesty and unwavering courage, Umar eventually set her free.
